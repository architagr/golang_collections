# golang_collections
This package is intended to implement all collections out of the box and using generics like List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Heaps, etc. 
Using generics for these collection will help us to use the type safety.

We have also done some basic benchmarking with some of the most commonly used packages. We have included the result in the respective documention of the collection.


### implemented collections:

- [Stack (using linked list)](stack/README.md)
- [Queue (using linked list)](queue/README.md)
- [Single linked list](list/singleLinkedList_README)
